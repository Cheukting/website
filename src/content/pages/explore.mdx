At EuroPython many attendees will come with their family. While not attending the conference, why not go and explore Prague and the surrounding area?

Here are some tips and things to do provided by our volunteers, hope it helps you and your companions to have a great time in Prague:

## Traveling around

### Public transport

In Prague the recommended way to get around is public transport:

- There‚Äôs some info [here](https://ep2024.europython.eu/where#getting-around-in-prague)
- You can use your normal card to travel around by train within Prague
- Usually fast and reliable
- After midnight the metro stops. - But there are buses
- Mostly safe, no no-go stations nor anything similar

### Do I need to hire a car?

Some people may consider hiring a car. But:

- In Prague it‚Äôs unnecessary, it‚Äôs hard to find parking and it‚Äôs expensive
- You can hire a car at the airport or anywhere (like you normally do in other cities)
- If you want to visit other towns, you can use trains as well (they‚Äôre mostly cheap)

### Be prepared for the weather

If you want to explor the city, you will be exposed to the weather. So here are teh answers to the questions: What‚Äôs the weather like? What to carry with you?

- Usually 30¬∞C+, so carry water
- There are no fountains nor public toilets, so carry more water
- Use Sunscreen
- It rarely rains, but when it does it‚Äôs shower rain - it‚Äôs the best to hide somewhere until it stops and it usually stops after half an hour or so.

## Where to eat?

Prague is a food city! There are many places you will find nice food, from traditional Czechia food to Vegan friendly food.

### General recommendation

Some yays and nays from our local volunteers:

- üëé Trdelnik is a tourist thing: nothing original or authentic
- üëé Pra≈æsk√° ≈°unka on the street: tourist trap
- üëç Try Nakl√°dan√Ω hermel√≠n (pickled camembert)
- üëç Sma≈æen√Ω s√Ωr (fried cheese)
- üëç Sv√≠ƒçkov√° (meat with vegetable sauce and dumplings)
- üëç Gul√°≈° (goulash)


### For veggie/ vegans

We know some of us are veggie / vegan. Don't worry, you will find places that serve you veggie / vegan food:

- Shromazdiste: typical czech food in vegan versions, great food and great beer
- Eateria: vegan junk food, best burger
- Pastva: open during day only, european and healthy food
- Dhaba beas: cheap buffet, indian and european food, it‚Äôs everywhere
- Share Sweet & Espresso Bar: coffee shop with best vegan cakes

According to HappyCow there are 89 vegan and vegetarian places to eat. So it should not be an issue to find something. Typical Czech restaurants mostly only offer fried cheese and french fries, sometimes pickled camembert.  Czech cuisine is mostly meat-heavy.
Hungry during the night? Go to any kebab place and you can order falafel wrap with veggies. You can also go to Burrito Loco - it‚Äôs a mexican food chain and they offer vegan mana burrito and burrito with grilled veggies.
